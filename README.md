* Random_Weighted_Graph.ipynb -- A Jupyter notebook written for SageMath 9.3 (download at https://www.sagemath.org/ or use the web interface at https://sagecell.sagemath.org/ )
    
    Creates a random integer-weighted graph with specified number of vertices, probability of an edge, minimum and maximum edge weights.
    
    Plots the graph, and provides a list containing the number of vertices, edges and weights.
    
    Note: Edge labels may overlap, suggest creating new graphs until a plot without overlapping labels is produced.
    
    
* go.bat -- A simple batch file for rapid testing of Project 4
    
    Needs to be in the same directory as Project 4's .java files.
